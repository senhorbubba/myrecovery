            <p>
               It’s my wife’s birthday. I feel bad - physically and emotionally.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pain is worse today. Still, I tried to make a small surprise: breakfast, waking up the kids, moving around the kitchen. It didn’t take long before I was exhausted. Sweating. Breathing heavy. Feeling weak and uncomfortable.

            </p>
            
             <p>
             How long does this phase last?

            </p>

             <p>
              Online answers are all over the place. Some say 5 days. Others 7. Some 11. Then you read that days 3–5 are the worst. Great!
            </p>

              <p>
           I went down another rabbit hole - braces. Why don’t I have one? Different surgeons, different philosophies. No clear answer, just strong opinions.


            </p>
            One thing does repeat everywhere:
            Don’t put a pillow under the knee. Put it under the calf.

            </p>
           The goal is full extension, as straight as possible, especially now. Keep the leg stretched when lying down. Easier said than done. It’s extremely uncomfortable. Joint pain, muscle pain, everything at once. I force it anyway. There’s a strange sensation behind the knee when I do this, which makes me wonder if the surgeon took a graft from my hamstring.
             </p>

        Later, I removed the first elastic layer of the bandage.
        Instant relief.
        I left the white bandage underneath, wrapped the leg in kitchen foil, and finally took a shower. It felt amazing - for a moment. Then the pain crept back in.

       
    </p>

            </p>
         
            Sometimes you feel slightly better. Then you stand up with crutches and suddenly your knee feels loose - like it’s not held together, like it might fall apart. A very unsettling sensation.


            </p>

       I managed to go to the toilet. Thought my head was going to explode. The last time I went was before surgery. All the medication and immobility didn’t help. It was harder than expected.



            </p>
           I also noticed strange bruises on my forehead and arms.
            Most likely related to the medication - especially the blood thinner.

               </p>

            </p>
           
           In the evening, we had a family dinner. Pain was still there, but mentally it helped a lot. Being around people pulls you away from dark thoughts.
            </p>

          


            </p>
        At night, I focused on sleeping with my leg as straight as possible.
             </p>




            </p>
            Not easy. Not perfect. But eventually, I found a position that worked: leg elevated, pillows under the calf, a small pillow under the thigh.
              </p>
           
            </p>
            I fell asleep.
            That felt like a win.

            </p>

        

            </p>
         
             </p>

          

            </p>
            
            </p> 

            
            </p>
            
            </p>
            

            </p>
