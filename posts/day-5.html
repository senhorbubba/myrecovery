               Woke up at 5:00 am. Fell back asleep. Woke again at 7:00.
            </p>
            <p>
              My watch says I slept well. I don’t feel like it. I feel tired.
            </p>
            
             <p>
             Today, I decided to stop taking Toragesic. The doctor originally prescribed it for seven days, but the leaflet says not to exceed five, even with medical approval. I’ll test going without it. The pain feels manageable: almost nothing when I’m sitting with my leg elevated, annoying but tolerable when moving around on crutches.
            </p>

             <p>
               The knee still feels loose.
            </p>

              <p>
           I took a shower and changed the bandages. The wound looks good -no discharge, clean edges, healing well. Hopefully everything inside is healing just as nicely.


            </p>
            Today was also the start of physiotherapy.
            </p>
           I first tried to find someone who could come to my gym, but without success. So I called the physio who helped me recover from golfer’s elbow. They focus on tennis, but they also do post-surgery rehabilitation.
             </p>

         The first session was tough.

       
    </p>

            </p>
         
            She immediately noticed that my extension is limited - that’s now the priority. We did stretching exercises where she manually pushed my leg into extension. Uncomfortable, but helpful. She used a bit of laser therapy to support internal healing, then electrostimulation to activate my quad. The leg is very weak, but it felt good to finally do something purposeful.
            After that, she massaged my quadriceps and hamstring. Painful, especially around the graft site, but necessary. She gave me three exercises to do at home. I’ll start incorporating them into my daily routine.
            Next session is scheduled for Monday.

            </p>

       



            </p>
            I worked today, still from home, but I felt overloaded. Too many things, no clear structure. Surgery, pain, medication, and physio have left me mentally scattered and out of routine. That’s affecting my work more than I expected.
               </p>

            </p>
           
            I need to reorganize my days.
            </p>

          


            </p>
        Emotionally, I notice mood swings. One moment I’m happy with the progress. The next, I’m frustrated by everything I can’t do yet.
             </p>




            </p>
            Recovery isn’t just physical.
              </p>
           
            </p>

            </p>

        

            </p>

             </p>
