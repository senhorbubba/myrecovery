            <p>
               The day was meant to be calm. Or at least as calm as it can be the day before surgery.
            </p>
            <p>
             My family came again in the morning. The room was still a mess, but in a funny way. Kids everywhere, moving eclectic furniture around as if the hospital room was their own playground. Noise, laughter, chaos. Normal life unfolding around an injured knee. I played with my little princess on the bed, lifting her up and down. She loved it. My knee did not. Still, it was worth it.
            </p>
            
             <p>
            When they finally left, the room became quiet. And with that, I felt more relaxed. I watched some TV, read a bit, answered a few work messages. The strategy for the day was simple: stay busy, rest, and eat well.
            </p>
             <p>
            At 14:00, the doctor came. We went through the MRI together. Bucket-handle meniscus tear, exactly what he suspected. It looks complicated, but he was calm while explaining it. That calm mattered more than the words themselves. Surgery was scheduled for Sunday at 8:00. He walked me through the procedure and answered my questions. Strangely, I did not have many. At this point, clarity felt more valuable than control.
            </p>

              <p>
           He was more concerned about my ACL. Five years ago, after a wakeboard accident, I partially tore it. The tear was small, so we chose not to operate and focused on strengthening instead. It worked, or at least it worked well enough. Now he suspects that old instability may have contributed to the meniscus injury. Tomorrow, during surgery, he will test the knee. If it proves unstable, he recommends fixing the ACL as well. That would add one to two months to recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
            Honestly, I am already fine with being out of tennis for four months. Adding two more does not change much. If anything, this feels like the best opportunity to fix everything properly. I trust him. I gave full approval to decide during the operation.
            </p>
            <p>
           Before leaving, he marked my knee. At least they will not operate on the wrong one tomorrow. The mark looks like a dart target.
             </p>
            <p>
            More medication. More rest. The day went by faster than I expected.
             </p>

            <p>
         
           Tomorrow, things stop being theoretical.

            </p>
