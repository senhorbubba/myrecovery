The procedure went well, but the real challenge started immediately after — numb legs, confusion, pain, and the first hard lessons of a. Leaving the hospital after midnight, exhausted and fragile, marked the true beginning of the comeback."

               Woke up early. 5:40 am.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shower with alcohol wipes. Shaved the leg. Hospital gown. Hat on. Waiting.
            Everything suddenly feels very procedural.


            </p>
            
             <p>
            Met the anesthesiologist. More questions. Explained what would happen. Calm voice. Reassuring, in theory.
            </p>

             <p>
            At 8:00 they came to get me.
            Nervous.
            The operating room is exactly what you imagine, bright lights, machines, people moving with purpose. They started adjusting my IV, adding more medication. Everyone looked relaxed.


            </p>

              <p>
           Except me.


            </p>
            A nurse held my hand. That helped.
            Then I was gone.


            </p>
           I woke up briefly in the observation room. Then passed out again.
            Woke up later in my hospital bed.

             </p>

        No feeling in my legs. Completely numb. Heavy. Exhausted.
        Surgery went well.


       
    </p>

            </p>
         
            Got my phone around 12:40. Called my wife. Couldn’t really talk. My brain was slow, words hard to find. I wanted yogurt and blueberries. She came.


            </p>

       ATP Finals were on. Tennis on TV felt surreal - like watching a different life. More medication. Lunch. Lying there, letting the day pass.



            </p>
           I couldn’t walk. Couldn’t feel my legs. Couldn’t feel my balls either - which might be the strangest sensation of all. Slowly, I started moving my toes. Left leg woke up first. Right leg stayed asleep longer.

               </p>

            </p>
           
           The plan was to go home at 20:00.

            </p>

          Really?


            </p>
        At 18:00 they asked me to pee. I couldn’t.
I felt like I needed to go.. badly.. but nothing happened. Sitting, standing, weak, dizzy. Running water from the sink. Watching YouTube videos of waterfalls. Still nothing.

             </p>

Every time I got close, someone asked, “Are you done?”
Back to square one.



            </p>
           My wife called asking if I wanted anything from the store.
Square one again.


              </p>
           Stress started creeping in. They explained that anesthesia can confuse the nervous system, the signal between brain and bladder just disappears.
            </p>
            Eventually, they put in a catheter.
Honestly? I tried. But it’s better not to wait too long.
They drained 850 ml.
It felt like a car getting an oil change - except I was watching TV while a nurse held my dick.
Instant relief.

            </p>
It was 21:00. Now I just needed to pee on my own to be discharged.
We finally left at 1:00 am. Tired. Disoriented. In pain. Taxi ride home feeling completely disabled. Everything hurt. Everything felt fragile.

        

            </p>
         At home, I couldn’t find a comfortable position.
Eventually, I fell asleep.

             </p>
Recovery had officially started.
          

            </p>
            
            </p> 

            
            </p>
            
            </p>
            

            </p>
