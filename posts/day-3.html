               Woke up feeling much better.
            </p>
            <p>
             WOW.
            I can almost lift my leg now - I still need to give it a little boost at the start, but it moves. I can put it on the ground with much less pain. Walking around the house feels possible. I’m still on medication, but I’m no longer counting the minutes until the next dose.

            </p>
            
             <p>
             That alone feels like progress.

            </p>

             <p>
              I worked a lot more today. Mentally sharper. More present.
            </p>

              <p>
           Today was also my return to the doctor. I was excited and full of questions: medication, physio, positions, braces, and everything I had read online.


            </p>
            Getting in and out of the taxi is still a struggle, but I guess that’s something you learn as you go. I’m much more confident with crutches now. I move slowly, deliberately. When I do that, the loose-knee feeling disappears. I’ve learned that lightly engaging the muscles makes everything feel more stable.
            </p>
           Whenever I stand, even in the elevator, I focus on straightening my leg.
             </p>

        At the clinic, the doctor removed the bandage. First time seeing the wound. It looks… impressive. But without the bandage, the knee actually feels better.
       
    </p>

            </p>
         
            The doctor is happy with the surgery. He walked me through everything in detail and answered all my questions. 


            </p>

       



            </p>
           Key detail: the graft was taken from my quadriceps. That explains the quad pain.
               </p>

            </p>
           
           It’s a newer technique, apparently the strongest and biggest graft available, behaving very similarly to a natural ACL. He even shared that he had the same graft done on his own knee five years ago. At the time, it was still considered fairly new and more demanding for the surgeon. Patellar or hamstring grafts are easier.
            </p>

          


            </p>
        That gave me a lot of confidence.
             </p>




            </p>
            My doctor is a black belt judoka. He understands my profile. I’m an athlete and I want to return to everything I love: tennis, kitesurfing, surfing, snowboarding, wakeboarding, golf. These are all rotational and impact sports. The goal isn’t just recovery - it’s resilience.
              </p>
           
            </p>
            About braces: they’re not used anymore. According to recent research, they often make things worse, not better. The focus now is mobility.
            </p>

        

            </p>
            I need to move the leg.
             </p>

          

            </p>
            This is where online advice and real medical guidance diverge. According to him, I should already be working toward 90 degrees of knee bend. That’s the goal. He recommended a simple exercise: sitting down with a skateboard, roller, or ball under the foot, moving the leg back and forth to bend the knee. We also need to activate the quads.
            </p> 

            These are the first exercises I’ve started with:
            [exercise link]
            </p>
            Back home, I started doing foot pumps and rolling the leg back and forth. Still taking medication, but overall I feel much better.
            </p>
            Went to sleep okay.
            Today felt like a turning point.
