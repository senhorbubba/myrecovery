            Resistance Bands: Small Tool, Massive Results
        </h1>
        <p class="text-xl text-gray-500 leading-relaxed">
            In the world of knee recovery, resistance bands are my best friends. They are cheap, portable, and give you the progressive tension you need to wake up sleepy muscles after ACL and meniscus surgery. If you want a tiny “portable gym” you can use at home, at work, or while traveling, this is it.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">My Two-Stage Strategy</h2>
        <p>
            I did not just buy one band and call it a day. I used two distinct types depending on my stage of recovery, because early rehab is about controlled range of motion and activation, and later rehab is about strength, stability, and better mechanics.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The Early Phase:</strong> I started with a <strong>long, wide, flat band</strong> (medium strength). It was perfect for assisted mobility work, gentle stretching, and light upper body pull-aparts while I was still limited. It let me move without yanking on my knee.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The Strength Phase:</strong> As I moved into later recovery, I switched to <strong>loop / mini bands</strong>. Putting these around my ankles or just above the knees for monster walks, glute bridges, and lateral steps was a total game-changer for hip control and quad support, which matters a lot when you start walking more and building confidence again.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want examples of how I used them day to day, I keep the movements organized on my <a href="../exercises.html">Exercises page</a>, and I share the bigger picture of how all of this fit into my rehab on the <a href="../index.html">Timeline</a>.

        For me, yes. Resistance bands made it easier to rebuild <strong>quad activation</strong>, <strong>hip stability</strong>, and control without needing heavy weights early on.

        I started with a long flat band early because it was gentle and helped with assisted mobility and light activation.
        The mini loop bands came later when my knee tolerated more load and I was focusing on glutes and lateral control.

        I prefer starting lighter than you think, especially early in recovery. A medium flat band covered most of my early needs,
        and with loop bands I liked having multiple levels so I could progress without changing my routine. If the band makes you compensate,
        it is too heavy for that stage.

        Ankles are harder because the lever is longer and the hip has to work more. If that makes your knee feel sketchy,
        move the band to just above the knees and focus on clean form and control. It is the same exercise, just a safer difficulty level.

        In my experience, yes. Cheap rubber loops often roll, pinch, and lose tension fast.
        Fabric-lined loops feel more stable and comfortable, which matters when you are trying to build consistency.
        That comfort kept me doing the work instead of avoiding it.

        Not for me. Bands were a bridge and a consistency tool, especially when traveling or on busy days.
        The bigger gains still came from progressive rehab over time. I treat bands like a smart way to keep the engine running,
        not the whole plan. For more travel and gear strategies, see

        I do a quick weekly check. Stretch the band and look for tiny cuts, thinning, or rough spots.
        If you see damage, replace it. Bands are cheap, setbacks are not. Also avoid sharp edges on doors or furniture when anchoring a band.

                    Check reviews for snapping, rolling, or losing tension. Brands like Theraband or Blackroll usually feel more consistent. It is worth paying a little more so the band does not fail mid set when you are trying to protect a healing knee.

                <p class="text-blue-50 opacity-90">
                    Loop bands around the ankles create more leverage and difficulty. If you feel strain around the surgical joint, move the band up to just above the knees to reduce the lever and keep the movement clean. I list the exact exercises I used on the <a href="../exercises.html" class="font-bold underline text-white">Exercises page</a>.

                <p class="text-blue-50 opacity-90">
                    Once a week, stretch your bands out and look for tiny nicks or micro tears. If you see any, throw the band away. These are disposable items, and replacing a band is much cheaper than dealing with a setback.
